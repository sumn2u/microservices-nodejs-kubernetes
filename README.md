This repo accompanies a [blog post](https://medium.com/@MostlyHarmlessD/getting-started-with-microservices-and-kubernetes-76354312b556).

## Runing the cluster

First build all of the custom docker containers:

```
$ docker build -t invoices_svc:v2 ./invoices_svc
$ docker build -t auth_svc:v1 ./auth_svc
$ docker build -t expected_date_svc:v1 ./expected_date_svc
```

Then apply all the cluster config:

```
$ kubectl apply -f ./kube
```



# Getting started with microservices and Kubernetes

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*RFgiyi6NsdMTDFVt2JxQ8g.png)
<span class="figcaption_hack">every microservices diagram ever</span>

It‚Äôs not a microservices platform if there‚Äôs only one service. And all those
services need to be able to talk to each other, they need to cope when some of
them are not feeling well, they need to run on real machines, they need to be
able to connect with the outside world and so much more besides.

This is where Kubernetes comes in ‚Äî it orchestrates the life and times of
individual Docker containers, giving us the primitives we need to construct
robust and scalable systems.

These microservices things are kind of a big deal right now but there are few
step by step guides to getting a basic system up and running. This is partly due
to the fact that the notion of a *‚Äúbasic microservice system‚Äù* is an oxymoron.
We‚Äôll try regardless.

We do need some pre requisite knowledge, specifically what
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is and what it‚Äôs for. After that you‚Äôll need
to know the Kube fundamentals:
[Pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod/),
[Services](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/),
[Deployments](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/)
et al.

This guide is mainly aimed at people who have got a single service running in
Kube and are thinking ‚Äú*now what?‚Äù*.

### Tldr; section

If you are more of a ‚Äòjust show me the code‚Äô sort of person, you‚Äôll really like
[this git repo](https://github.com/fluidly/total_invoice_management). Otherwise
read on.

### Before we start

All our microservices will be written in [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) v8.x
so you‚Äôll want to go install that first. They‚Äôll all be very simple so you won‚Äôt
need more than the most cursory javascript / node knowledge.

We‚Äôre going to run all this on
[Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/minikube/), it‚Äôs a
neat way of getting Kube running locally. You can find installation instructions
[here](https://labs.consol.de/development/java/kubernetes/2017/02/10/minikube.html).
After that you‚Äôll want to verify that your Minikube installation is all good.

First create a Minikube cluster:

    $ minikube start

    Starting local Kubernetes v1.8.0 cluster...
    Starting VM...
    Getting VM IP address...
    Moving files into cluster...
    Setting up certs...
    Connecting to cluster...
    Setting up kubeconfig...
    Starting cluster components...
    Kubectl is now configured to use the cluster.
    Loading cached images from config file.

Then check that the Kube system services are all happy:

    $ kubectl get services -n kube-system

    NAME                   CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)         AGE
    kube-dns               10.96.0.10      <none>        53/UDP,53/TCP   1m
    kubernetes-dashboard   10.107.19.167   <nodes>       80:30000/TCP    1m

One more thing, we need Minikube to share our local docker registry, else it
won‚Äôt be able to find the docker images that we build.


Super. Now let‚Äôs build something fun.

### TOTAL INVOICE MANAGEMENT!!!1!

Lets build a system that manages invoices for a company. Sounds simple enough
and it‚Äôs also the most fun thing I could think of. Our system will comprise of:

* An **API gateway** to route traffic into our system
* An **authentication service** to limit access
* A front end **invoices service** to return information about invoices
* A back end **expected date service** that‚Äôll tell us when an invoice is likely
to be paid

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*SCcK71yEwP6wxYP7SxRVJg.png)
<span class="figcaption_hack">the basics</span>

The first step is getting our folder structure sorted. We‚Äôll have one folder for
all our kube config files, and others for each of our services.

    - total_invoice_managment
    |
    | - kube
    | - invoices_svc

#### The invoices service

Our first service is `invoices_svc` which is responsible for individual
invoices. It‚Äôll have a single endpoint `api/invoices/:id` which will swap an id
for the invoice data. Lets quickly scaffold the service using the node package
manager ([npm](http://npmjs.com/)).

    $ cd ./invoices_svc
    $ npm init 
    # then say yes to everything
    $ npm install express

Update `package.json` to include the script to boot the app:

Add the `index.js` file that contains the code for the service:

Verify that it runs locally:

    $ PORT=3007 npm start

    invoices_svc listening on 3007

    $ curl localhost:3007/api/invoices/10

    {"id":10,"ref":"INV-10","amount":1000,"balance":990,"ccy":"GBP"}

It works! Satisfied that our service works as expected, we can now dockerize it
by making a
[Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#usage):

Then we can build the Docker container to make sure all is well:

    $ docker build ./ -t invoices_svc:v1

Time to start on getting this service into Kube. Lets change directory to the
`kube` folder a level up:

    $ cd ../kube

And add our first bit of kube config. Call the file `invoices_svc.yaml`

This config defines a Kube
[service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/) and
it‚Äôs accompanying
[deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/).
We can ask kube to boot it up

    $ kubectl apply -f ./invoices_svc.yaml

    deployment "invoices-svc" created
    service "invoices-svc" created

We should see its service:

    $ kubectl get services

    NAME           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
    invoices-svc   10.104.86.220   <none>        80/TCP    3m
    kubernetes     10.96.0.1       <none>        443/TCP   1h

And all the pods too:

    $ kubectl get pods

    NAME                            READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    invoices-svc-65b5f7bbd4-ckr8d   1/1       Running   0          44s
    invoices-svc-65b5f7bbd4-gvk9s   1/1       Running   0          44s
    invoices-svc-65b5f7bbd4-z2kx7   1/1       Running   0          44s

As there‚Äôs no external IP for `invoices_svc` we‚Äôll need to get into a container
*inside* the cluster to be able to try it out. Spinning one up specially seems
odd, but it‚Äôs a very kubey way of doing things. Busyboxplus is just a container
that has a basic shell and some common tools. We need it to use `curl`.


    [ root@curl-696777f579-qwjcr:/ ]$ curl 10.104.86.220/api/invoices/1

    {"id":1,"ref":"INV-1","amount":100,"balance":90,"ccy":"GBP"}

(To escape the container you need to press `ctl-d)`

It works! Sort of. It‚Äôs pretty useless being stuck inside our cluster - we need
to create an *ingress* so that traffic can find it‚Äôs way in. We are going to use
[Ambassador](https://www.getambassador.io/) for this. It‚Äôs a handy wrapper
around [Envoy Proxy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/) and has lots of great API
gateway features built in. Routing seems like a good place to start.

We‚Äôll need to get Ambassador running on our cluster. Create a file called
`ambassador.yaml` in the `kube` folder:

And then we can boot it up:

    $ kubectl apply -f ./ambassador.yaml

    $ kubectl get services
    NAME               CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
    ambassador         10.103.215.136   <pending>     80:32005/TCP     11s
    ambassador-admin   10.104.3.82      <nodes>       8877:31385/TCP   11s
    invoices-svc       10.104.86.220    <none>        80/TCP           45m
    kubernetes         10.96.0.1        <none>        443/TCP          2h

We need to tell ambassador about our `invoices_svc` though, and we do so by
adding some annotations to the`Service` section of `invoices_svc.yaml`

The `prefix` key routes traffic from `/invoices/` to our service. To keep things
nice and tidy the `rewrite` key does a bit of transforming too so that traffic
to `/invoices/:id` gets routed to our service at `/api/invoices/:id.`

Once the config has been added, we can apply it:

    $ kubectl apply -f ./invoices_svc.yaml

Ambassador keeps watch over everything that happens in the cluster. When we
updated the config, ambassador detected that change and went looking for any
annotations. It found them, and will now route traffic to the service.

In theory, we now have a working external api gateway to our cluster. Before we
can validate that hypothesis we need to create a tunnel from our localhost to
the minikube cluster:

    $ minikube service ambassador --url


This particular url is only for my local machine ‚Äî **you need to use your own
for future steps**.

We can use the returned url to reach our cluster:

    $ curl 

    {"id":42,"ref":"INV-42","amount":4200,"balance":4190,"ccy":"GBP"}

üéâ It works! So we have a service and a gateway.

#### Adding authentication

It‚Äôs not great having our service available to world + dog. We should add some
kind of authentication to our gateway. Nobody will be surprised to hear that
we‚Äôll want a new service for that, or that it‚Äôll be called `auth_svc`.

* Create a new folder called `auth_svc`
* Copy the `Dockerfile` from `invoices_svc`
* Repeat the npm steps that we did for `invoices_svc`

    $ cd ../
    $ mkdir 
    $ cd ./
    $ npm init
    $ npm install express
    $ cp ../invoices_svc/Dockerfile .

    # don't forget to add "start": "node index.js" to your package.json!

* Create the `auth_svc` app:

* Create the kube config:

* Build the docker image:

    $ docker build -t auth_svc:v1 ./auth_svc/

* Apply the kube config:

    $  kubectl apply -f ./kube/auth_svc.yaml

* see if it worked:

    $ curl 

    {"ok":false}

Aces, we are now locked out, unless we know the magic word:

    $  curl 
     -H 'authorization: letmeinpleasekthxbye'

    {"id":42,"ref":"INV-42","amount":4200,"balance":4190,"ccy":"GBP"}

Let‚Äôs take stock. We have an API gateway that authenticates traffic and routes
it to our service. However we don‚Äôt want **all** of our services to be public,
what about back end services that our front end services call? Well, Kube has a
way of doing that too.

#### When do I get paid?

It‚Äôs always nice to know when your customers will pay you. We will create an
*extreme high sophistication algorithmic inference engine* *that‚Äôll tell us when
an invoice is expected to be paid. It‚Äôs a similar jig to the last two services:

    $ cd ../
    $ mkdir expected_date_svc
    $ cd ./expected_date_svc
    $ npm init
    $ npm install express
    $ npm install moment 
    $ cp ../invoices_svc/Dockerfile .

    # don't forget to add "start": "node index.js" to your package.json!

And the *extreme high sophistication algorithmic inference engine *code is*:*

That just leaves the kube config:

You know the drill:

    $ docker build -t expected_date_svc:v1 .
    $ kubectl apply -f ../kube/expected_date_svc.yaml
    $ kubectl get services

    NAME                CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
    ambassador          10.103.215.136   <pending>     80:32005/TCP     19h
    ambassador-admin    10.104.3.82      <nodes>       8877:31385/TCP   19h
    auth-svc            10.108.119.134   <none>        3000/TCP         18h
    expected-date-svc   10.101.227.50    <none>        80/TCP           1m
    invoices-svc        10.104.86.220    <none>        80/TCP           20h
    kubernetes          10.96.0.1        <none>        443/TCP          21h

So now we have the `expected_date_svc` running, we‚Äôll want to modify the
`invoices_svc` to make us of it.

There‚Äôs a new dependency we need to make a http request:

    $ cd ../invoices_svc
    $ npm install request-promise
    $ npm install request

Then we make a request to the `expected_date_svc` and add the result to our
invoice object. Here‚Äôs the updated `invoice_svc`:

We need to rebuild the docker image:

    $ docker build -t invoices_svc:v2 .

And we also need to update the kube config for the `invoices_svc`

First up, it needs to reference the new docker image:

We also need to add an environment variable that contains the url to the
`expected_svc`. This is the nifty bit. Kubernetes uses internal DNS routing ‚Äî
you can read more about that
[here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/dns-pod-service/).
The short version is that kube creates a special url for every named service.
Its format is `SVCNAME.NAMESPACE.svc.cluster.local`, so the `expected_date_svc`
can be found at `expected-date-svc.default.svc.cluster.local`. Lets go set that
environment variable by updating the config:

Now that the config is all updated, we apply it to the cluster:

    $ kubectl apply -f ../kube/invoices_svc.yaml

And check that the expected date is being added:

    $ curl 
     -H 'authorization: letmeinpleasekthxbye'

    {"id":42,"ref":"INV-42","amount":4200,"balance":4190,"ccy":"GBP","expectedDate":"2018-01-01T11:54:30.769Z"}

*****

This should be enough for the reader to get a cluster running. Next steps
include adding and removing replicas to scale services, adding a [liveness
probe](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-probes/#define-a-liveness-http-request)
so that kubernetes knows if a service fails silently or logging and monitoring
so we can find out what our services are up to when we aren‚Äôt looking.

#### I like it!

Great, us too. We like kube so much that we use it for our most demanding
infrastructure requirements at [Fluidly](https://fluidly.com/), in particular
for our data science models. It‚Äôs a steep learning curve, but the rewards are
substantial.

If you encounter an error with kubectl not being able to pull your image, but
you can see the image when you run `docker image ls` . It is probably because
you switched to a different shell session where you no longer have the docker

If you were to run a web app long with the rest of these services (let‚Äôs say a
React.js application) would you use ambassador for mapping to the web app?

Hi Damian Esteban,

You **could** do, but in this case those requests would need to be authenticated
which isn‚Äôt what you want. You **could** write some code in your authentication
service to permit all requests from some domain, but that feels pretty messy to
me.

Thanks for the advice. Right now I‚Äôm just exposing the web application via a
NodePort but that‚Äôs just a temporary solution. It isn‚Äôt managed by Ambassador.
Would you expose it via a LoadBalancer maybe instead of a NodePort? I should
mention that I‚Äôll be running this on AWS via kops, but right now it‚Äôs running on
MiniKube.

Yep, a load balancer egress should do the job nicely.

This article cleared up so many basic questions that I had about Kubernetes.
Seeing a simple example like this laid out beginning to end I incredibly
helpful. Thank you.

Hi Kyle Marvich, it‚Äôs really hard to say what‚Äôs wrong without seeing the full
